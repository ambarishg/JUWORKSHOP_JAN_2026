       "' ## **Description and identification**\\n\\n\\nThis bee is black and densely covered in a grey pubescence or\\nfur on the [dorsal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location) side. The [thorax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax_(insect_anatomy)) fur has a slightly yellow\\ncolor. The legs have a mixture of black and reddish fur. The\\n[ventral side of the bee is covered in a brownish or dark yellow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location)\\nfur. The wings are fairly transparent except for the black veins\\nthat run through them. Males and females are similar in size at\\nabout 16–17 millimeters. Males have eyes more yellow in\\ncolor, and their thorax fur is lighter. Females have eyes more\\ngreen in color, and their thorax fur is more brown than grey. [[3]]\\n\\n## **Distribution and habitat**\\n\\n\\n_Centris pallida_ are located in dry, hot environments of North\\nAmerica. Specifically, they are in Arizona, Nevada, southern\\nCalifornia, New Mexico, and western Mexico. [[4]] They are a\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nvery common bee (especially in Arizona), and are thus\\n[classified as Least Concern in terms of conservation.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least-concern_species) [[5]] The fur\\nand dark colored exoskeleton allow the bees to survive the cold\\nnights in the desert. During the daytime, _C. pallida_ are almost\\ncompletely inactive, hiding in shade or in burrows to prevent\\noverheating. [[6]]\\n\\n## **Life cycle**\\n\\n### **Making** **chambers**\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA _C. pallida_ female will\\nfind a spot for her nest. She\\nwill then dig diagonally\\ndown about 12 inches\\n(30 cm). At the end of this\\ntunnel, she will dig a 1 inch\\n(2.5 cm) long vertical\\nchamber where the egg will\\nbe laid. The chamber will\\nbe about 8 inches (20 cm)\\n\\n_Centris pallida_ brood pot [42463665).](https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/42463639/42463665) _[IUCN Red List of Threatened Species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN_Red_List)_ .
